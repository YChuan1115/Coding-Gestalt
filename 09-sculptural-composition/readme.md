Structural Composition
======================

In this lecture you will learn how to:

* identify events as basic forms
* transmit events via OSC
* group events to forms using gestalt laws


## Setup

----

**Detector → Transmission → Composer** 

----

*Detector*  — Detect Events in the Data  
*Composer*  —  Perceive + Create Forms

----

### Detector

*Input* — Continuous data  
*Process* — Identify events  
*Output* — Sequence of events

### Transmission

Open Sound Control


### Composer

*Perceive*

*Input:* — Sequence of Events  
*Process* — Group Events using Gestalt Laws  
*Output* — Nested Events 

*Create*

*Input* — Nested Events  
*Process* — Generate Visuals using Gestalt Laws  
*Output* — Visual Form or 3D Shape  


## Events

Typical Event Attributes are:

* Onset
* Type
* Intensity
* Duration

## Open Sound Control

Exercises — Structural Composition 
==================================

### [Exercise 01][] – Soccer Data

1. Get `full-game.gz` and it extract it to the `data/soccer` folder of the repo
2. Write a sketch that reads events from the file
3. Use the `oscP5` library to emit OSC signals

### [Exercise 02][] – Visual Form

1. Write a sketch to receive the OSC signals created in the exercises
2. Create a simple visualization
3. Use Gestalt laws to group events and create more complex forms
4. Visualize those forms in 2D

### [Exercise 03][] – Structural Composition

1. Write a sketch to receive the OSC signals created in the exercises
2. Use gestalt laws to group events and create more complex forms
2. Visualize those forms in 3D
3. Export the data as polygon mesh or GCODE.
